          <h2>Functionality:</h2>
          <p>
            Normal insulators play a crucial role in power transmission systems by preventing the flow of electrical current between the power line and the supporting structures (such as poles or towers).
          </p>
          <h2>Material:</h2>
          <p>
            They are typically made of materials like porcelain, glass, or polymers with excellent insulating properties.
          </p>
          <h2>Appearance:</h2>
          <p>
            Normal insulators often have a consistent, unblemished appearance. They are designed to withstand environmental factors such as weather, temperature changes, and pollution.
          </p>
          <h2>Maintenance:</h2>
          <p>
          Regular inspection and maintenance ensure that normal insulators continue to function effectively. They are expected to remain free from visible damage or defects during routine checks.
          </p>
          <h3 className="small-bold-text">Defective Insulators</h3>
          <h2>Types of Defects:</h2>
          <p>
          Defective insulators can exhibit various issues, including physical damage, contamination, cracks, or electrical breakdown.
          </p>
          <h2>Causes of Defects:</h2>
          <p>
          Defects can result from factors such as environmental stress, mechanical damage, manufacturing flaws, or prolonged exposure to harsh conditions.
          </p>
          <h2>Visual Indicators:</h2>
          <p>
          Visual inspection may reveal signs of discoloration, chipping, or irregularities on the surface of defective insulators. Cracks or breaks may also be present.
          </p>
          <h2>Impact on Performance:</h2>
          <p>
          Defective insulators compromise the integrity of the power transmission system, potentially leading to electrical failures, outages, or safety hazards.
          </p>
          <h2>Monitoring and Replacement:</h2>
          <p>
          Continuous monitoring and timely replacement of defective insulators are crucial to maintaining the reliability and safety of powerlines.
