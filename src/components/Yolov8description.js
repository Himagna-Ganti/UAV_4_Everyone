              How we did it ??
              <br/>
              YOLOv8 is a powerful object detection algorithm that can be used for detecting and 
              classifying insulation faults on transmission line insulator strings based on computer vision.
              It not only detects defects in the insulators of power transmission lines but also adds the 
              identification of birds' nests, making it suitable for various real-world scenarios such as 
              autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and power line inspection.
              <br/>
              Advantages of using YOLOv8 in this context include its ability to detect and classify insulation 
              faults with high accuracy, faster inference speeds, and support for various backbones, such as 
              EfficientNet, ResNet, and CSPDarknet. Additionally, YOLOv8 provides pre-trained models for easy 
              use and transfer learning on various datasets, making it suitable for detecting defects in power 
              line insulators. The model also offers advanced data augmentation techniques and a highly customizable 
              architecture that allows users to modify the model's structure and parameters to suit their specific needs.
              <br/>
              Some potential setbacks of using YOLOv8 for detecting defects in power line insulators include the 
              difficulty in training and slow detection speed for small-object detection in UAV aerial photography scenarios.
              Despite these setbacks, YOLOv8 remains a state-of-the-art model that offers unprecedented speed and accuracy for 
              detecting defects in power line insulators, making it a valuable tool for automated UAV power line inspection 
              and maintenance.
